VT100 to ATX power supply adapter

This project adapts an off-the-shelf computer power supply to replace the power supply found in a Digital VT100 serial terminal.

As of now, this will not work with a VT103, as it does not generate BPOK and BDCOK signals. It should, however, work with the VT101 and VT102.

The terminal is not mounted to the PCB, allowing for positioning in various locations in the power supply bay of the VT100.
